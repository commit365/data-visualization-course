## Lesson 4: Advanced Visualization Techniques in Tableau

### Building Dashboards and Stories

Dashboards and stories in Tableau allow you to present multiple visualizations in a cohesive manner, enabling viewers to gain insights from various perspectives.

#### 1. Building a Dashboard

A dashboard is a collection of visualizations that are displayed together on a single screen. Here’s how to create a dashboard in Tableau:

- **Step 1**: Open Tableau and navigate to the workbook containing the visualizations you want to include in your dashboard.

- **Step 2**: Click on the “New Dashboard” button located at the bottom of the Tableau interface. This will create a new dashboard tab.

- **Step 3**: In the Dashboard pane on the left, you will see all the sheets (visualizations) available in your workbook. Drag and drop the desired sheets onto the dashboard canvas.

- **Step 4**: Arrange and resize the visualizations as needed. You can click and drag the edges of each visualization to adjust their sizes and positions.

- **Step 5**: To add interactivity, you can include filters or actions. For example, drag a filter to the dashboard to allow users to filter all visualizations simultaneously based on a specific field (e.g., "Region").

- **Step 6**: Customize the dashboard by adding text boxes, images, or web content. Use the “Objects” section in the Dashboard pane to drag these elements onto the canvas.

- **Step 7**: Once you are satisfied with your dashboard, save your work. You can also publish the dashboard to Tableau Server or Tableau Online for sharing with others.

#### 2. Creating a Story

A story in Tableau is a sequence of visualizations that work together to convey a narrative. Here’s how to create a story:

- **Step 1**: Click on the “New Story” button at the bottom of the Tableau interface. This will create a new story tab.

- **Step 2**: In the Story pane on the left, you will see options to add story points. Each story point can contain a visualization, a dashboard, or a text description.

- **Step 3**: Drag a sheet or dashboard into the first story point. You can also add a title and description to provide context for the visualization.

- **Step 4**: Continue adding additional story points by clicking the “+” button. You can include different visualizations or dashboards that build upon the narrative.

- **Step 5**: Use the “Navigation” options to allow viewers to move through the story points easily. You can also customize the layout and formatting of each story point.

- **Step 6**: Save your story and publish it to share with others. Stories are an effective way to guide audiences through data insights and findings.

### Implementing Calculated Fields and Parameters for Dynamic Visuals

Calculated fields and parameters are powerful features in Tableau that allow you to create dynamic and customized visualizations.

#### 1. Creating Calculated Fields

Calculated fields enable you to create new data based on existing fields in your dataset. Here’s how to create a calculated field:

- **Step 1**: In the Data pane, right-click on the data source and select “Create Calculated Field.”

- **Step 2**: In the calculation editor that appears, give your calculated field a name (e.g., "Profit Margin").

- **Step 3**: Enter the calculation formula. For example, to calculate profit margin, you could use the formula:
  ```plaintext
  [Profit] / [Sales]
  ```
- **Step 4**: Click “OK” to create the calculated field. The new field will appear in the Data pane and can be used in your visualizations.

- **Step 5**: Drag the calculated field into your visualization to see the results. You can use calculated fields to create complex metrics, ratios, or custom aggregations.

#### 2. Using Parameters

Parameters are dynamic values that can replace a constant value in calculations, filters, or reference lines. Here’s how to create and use a parameter:

- **Step 1**: In the Data pane, right-click and select “Create Parameter.”

- **Step 2**: In the parameter dialog box, give your parameter a name (e.g., "Sales Target") and define its data type (e.g., Integer, Float).

- **Step 3**: Set the allowable values for the parameter. You can choose from a list, a range, or all values.

- **Step 4**: Click “OK” to create the parameter. It will appear in the Data pane.

- **Step 5**: To use the parameter in a calculated field, create a new calculated field that incorporates the parameter. For example:
  ```plaintext
  IF [Sales] > [Sales Target] THEN "Above Target" ELSE "Below Target" END
  ```

- **Step 6**: Drag the parameter control to your dashboard or worksheet to allow users to adjust the parameter value dynamically. This interactivity enables viewers to explore different scenarios based on their input.

### Conclusion

In this lesson, you learned how to build dashboards and stories in Tableau to present multiple visualizations effectively. You also explored how to implement calculated fields and parameters to create dynamic and customized visuals. These advanced techniques will enhance your ability to communicate insights and engage your audience through data visualization.
